# TODO

## 1. Type Declarations

- Add type declarations (type aliases) so complex types can be named and reused more easily.

## 2. Tuple Types

- Add tuple type syntax and semantics so tuples can hold multiple values in one typed value.

## 3. Structs

- Add struct declarations and typed struct values.

## 4. Custom Libraries

- Add support for custom libraries (for example, a `math` library).

## 5. OOP and Type System Expansion

- Add class declarations and object instantiation.
- Add access modifiers (`public` / `private`) for fields and methods.
- Add `static` fields and functions on classes.
- Add `main` function for what to run.
- Add instance methods and method dispatch on objects.
- Add constructors and initialization hooks.
- Add inheritance (or another clear composition model) with overriding rules.
- Expand type naming and introspection for class/instance/union/array types.
- Add member access (`obj.field`, `Class.staticField`) with visibility enforcement.
- Add tests and codegen parity for all OOP and visibility features.
